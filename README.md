# K-groups

K-groups implements energy clustering for a specified number of classes by energy distance criterion. 

This package replaces the pre-release version of 2017-11-17 kgroups 0.1.3 at https://github.com/mariarizzo/kgroups, which remains available in a branch. This version is not an update but a new version. It is entirely rewritten and at least 100 times faster as of version 0.2.0.
