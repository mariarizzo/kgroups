Description: K-groups implements energy clustering for a specified number k classes by energy distance criterion, analogous to the k classes of the k-means algorithm. K-groups is based on a characterization of equality of distributions; thus k-groups separates clusters based on all types 
             of differences in distributions, which is more general than
             k-means, based on differences in means.
