Description: K-groups implements energy clustering for a specified number k classes 
             by energy distance criterion, analogous to the k classes of the k-means 
             algorithm. K-groups is based on a characterization of equality of 
             distributions; thus k-groups separates clusters based on all types 
             of differences in distributions, which is more general than k-means, 
             which is based only on differences in means.
